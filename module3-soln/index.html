        <h2 class="text-center">Chicken</h2>
        <p>The chickens that saved Western civilization were discovered, according to legend, by the side of a road in
          Greece in the first decade of the fifth century B.C. The Athenian general Themistocles, on his way to confront
          the invading Persian forces, stopped to watch two cocks fighting and summoned his troops, saying: “Behold,
          these do not fight for their household gods, for the monuments of their ancestors, for glory, for liberty or
          the safety of their children, but only because one will not give way to the other.” The tale does not describe
          what happened to the loser, nor explain why the soldiers found this display of instinctive aggression
          inspirational rather than pointless and depressing. But history records that the Greeks, thus heartened, went
          on to repel the invaders, preserving the civilization that today honors those same creatures by breading,
          frying and dipping them into one’s choice of sauce. The descendants of those roosters might well think—if they
          were capable of such profound thought—that their ancient forebears have a lot to answer for.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Beef</h2>
        <p>Beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef is obtained from
          early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, fine-grained lean, bright red in
          colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy white, and well distributed. In young beef the bones are
          soft, porous, and red; the less desirable mature beef has hard white bones. Beef tenderness and flavour are
          improved by aging; in one common aging method the carcass is hung for about two weeks at approximately 36 °F
          (2 °C), encouraging physical changes in the muscle tissue that enhance the quality of the meat.Grading
          standards are somewhat similar in various countries; there is a large international beef trade. In the United
          States, grades in order of quality are prime, choice, good, commercial, utility, cutter, and canner.
          Commercial grades are mainly from mature cattle, especially cows. Utility, cutter, and canner grades are used
          in processed meat products. Beef hide, used for leather manufacture, is a valuable by-product of beef.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Sushi</h2>
        <p>How did sushi get its name? Tracing its trajectory is as fascinating as the name sushi itself is. It is
          believed that the word sushi literally means 'it is sour' which is used to describe the ancient process of
          making sushi,with raw seafood rolled into rice along with salt for facilitating the fermentation process.
          Gradually, the preservation method was discovered in China and Japan, where Japan went a step further. Today,
          Japan has the most exciting night life and back then, there were significant transformations taking place.
          With Edo as the Capital of Japan, entrepreneurs developed quicker ways to prepare the sushi. Vinegar aided the
          process. The Japanese began eating the rice along with the fish. It was Matsumoto Yoshiichi of Tokyo who began
          to add vinegar in his sushi to sell it. This allowed the customers to eat it immediately rather than waiting
          for the process of fermentation to start. This why the sushi kitchen is called tsuke-ba or "pickling place."
          The process of fermenting the rice releases acid that allow the fish to last longer.</p>
