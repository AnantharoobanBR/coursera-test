            <p>A fountain pen did not work as intended, the moment you bought it. It had to be tamed and domesticated as one
                would train a pet dog. In the beginning, the pen had a mind of its own. It was rough, scratchy and with no
                smooth flow. It required strong-arm tactics like polishing the nib on a piece of coarse sandpaper. In due
                course of time, it was no longer a pen, but an extended arm. As we dotted the ‘i’s and crossed the ‘t’s
                through reams of paper, it was artwork all the way!</p>

            <h3 id="gpen">Gell Pen</h3>
            <p>Compared to other inks, gel ink has higher viscosity, which supports a higher proportion of pigments in the
                medium. The pigments are opaque, and gel pens are available in several bright and pastel colours, as well as
                opalescent, metallic, and glittery colours which show up clearly on dark paper. Many gel inks are water
                resistant, and are not washed away by water once the ink has dried. Fraud resistant gel ink is unaffected by
                solvents such as acetone, and resists check washing.</p>

            <h3 id="bpen">Ball Point Pen</h3>
            <p>The principle at the heart of the ballpoint pen mimics the action of a roll-on deodorant – gravity and the
                force applied smear the rolling ball with a continuous stream of ink as the ball rolls along the writing
                surface When the pen isn’t used, the ball sits tight against the end of the ink reservoir, preventing air
                entering and drying out the ink. Most often, ballpoint pens run out of ink long before they dry out.</p>
